# Sentiment Analysis for Contextual Signals from Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using a neural network built with Keras and GloVe word embeddings. The model classifies reviews as either positive or negative.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project_name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The data is sourced from Amazon product reviews and can be downloaded from Kaggle. The processed data is stored in the data/ directory.

## Model Architecture

The model uses the following layers:

1. Embedding layer initialized with GloVe embeddings.
2. 1D Convolutional layers.
3. CuDNNLSTM layers for sequence modeling.
4. Dense layers for binary classification.

## Training

You can train the model by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss. Evaluation results will be printed to the console after training.
